Contributions
=============

All team members contributed **equally** to this project, with each member playing an inportant role in all phases of development. 
Each member dedicated approximately **33% of the effort**, ensuring a balanced and collaborative approach to:

- **Dataset creation**: Collecting, cleaning, and structuring the questionnaire data.
- **Model training**: Implementing, fine-tuning, and evaluating large language models.
- **Evaluation and analysis**: Analyzing model performance and iterating on improvements.
- **Presentation and documentation**: Preparing the final reports, visualizations, and this documentation.

This equal distribution of work ensured that each aspect of the project was well-integrated and thoroughly reviewed by all members.
We tried to focus on each step together, to make sure that all learnings and understanding of the underlying structure of data and models is shared among all members of our group.
